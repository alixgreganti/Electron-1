This *was* supposed to be me just putting nothing useful here, but I ended up finding a really easy way to just isolate a webpage and serve it as a single exe. It's simple af, I just think it's neat.

npm install electron --save-dev
npm install electron-packager --save-dev
npm install --save-dev electron-builder
